# LP22

- LP - 106326.pl refers to the final and submitted solution proposed.
- test.pl refers to a different solution of the last proposed problem I experimented with, using the permutation() function as opposed to findall(). I settled with the latter due to the reduced computing time it provided.
- dados.pl and keywords.pl are files provided by the course faculty, and serve as the knowledge base of the program.
- projectoLP_2022.pdf and FAQs.rtf are, respectively, the list of proposed problems for this project and a FAQ about them. These two files were provided by the faculty.
